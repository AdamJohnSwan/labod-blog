Today I am launching the beta version of TrackLaw.

TrackLaw's role is to provide a simple and fast interface for subscribing to legislative changes. Users will be notified of changes as the bills go through the legislative process.

The goal of TrackLaw and how it differentiates itself from other applications are divided into two parts.
1. Keep the interface simple, fast, and cheap. TrackLaw will provide the ability to subscribe to multiple legislative changes and create numerous keyword searches, all at no cost.
2. Tracking local government. Local government websites are often cryptic and challenging to navigate. TrackLaw will provide a way of tracking legislation in major municipalities.

Some key features
- Executive order notifications: Get notified when a new executive order is published.
- Track bills in real-time: Easily search for and follow bills from local, state, and federal legislative bodies.
- Instant Notifications: Get notified via email whenever there is a status change in your tracked legislation.
- Search by keyword: Create subscriptions for keywords, and get notified as bills are introduced.
